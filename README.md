# Bitrix24HelpDesk
 Bitrix24 Extended HelpDesk
 
This extension of the technical support module creates a page for administering tickets in the public part of Bitrix24.

When creating a ticket from an email, a task is created based on this ticket. The task is tied to the CRM Contact from the email of which the ticket was created. 

If there is no contact yet, a new contact is created.

When closing a ticket, the task closes.

When the task is closed, the ticket closes.
